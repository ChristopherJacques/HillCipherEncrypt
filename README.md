# HillCipherEncrypt
I created a Python program that takes two text files-  a key file and a plain text file, and outputs an encrypted text file.

To use this program input the code into the IDE of your choice

Execute using the following commands in shell:

"Python3 pa01.py key.txt plaintext.txt"

I created this progam for my security in computing class... Enjoy!
